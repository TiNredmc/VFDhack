# VFDhack
VFDhack is the project that I tried to code the library for MN15439A. More Info on my blog https://tinlethax.wordpress.com/2020/05/01/six-years-of-finding-the-datasheet-and-pinout-of-the-mn15439a/

# Datasheet

Unfortunately, There's no datasheet for this VFD Display but as far as I know

1. Manufactured by Noritake Itron. 
2. It's Chip In Glass Vacuum Fluorescent Display 
3. It used to be the main Display in CDX-GT700D. Car stereo CD player made by SONY way back in 2005s.
4. This display is custom-made. SONY signed Non-Disclosure-Agreement (NDA) with Noritake Itron. So no full datasheet available D:


But there's one of the display that close enought to be the manufacturing baseline for the MN15439A. It's MN14440A 

# BUT I DO HAVE PINOUT
